## Overall Structure

#### Back end
The app was built using Ruby on Rails on the back end with a postgreSQL database.
Back end structure is RESTful and all the data requests use AJAX and are fulfilled with a JSON API.
Associations are used to prefetch data in order to minimize SQL queries to the database.

#### Front end
The front end is built completely in [React.js][React] and JavaScript and utilizes React's [Flux][Flux] architecture.
React's virtual DOM allows for lightning-quick re-rendering without requiring new pages to be sent from the server.

#### Libraries

Investments With Friends uses:
- [React.js][React]
- [Flux][Flux]
- [BCrypt](https://github.com/codahale/bcrypt-ruby) for authorization
- [Paperclip](https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip) to store user profile images using Amazon Web Services
- [figaro](https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro) to securely store keys and other important data.
- [Amazon Web Services][aws] for file hosting, and image upload.

## Primary Components
